# Nobel Prize Data Warehouse Project
This project will create a complex Nobel Prize Data Warehouse that consists of 8 dimensions and 3 facts. These dimensions and facts come from 8 CSV files (Category, Country, Institution, Institution Type, Laureate, Motivation, Overall Motivation, and Prize) that were manipulated and created based on the 3 original files (Prize, Country, and Laureate) from the Harvard Dataverse dataset, Nobel Prize - Dataset with Information about Prizes, Laureates and Countries, authored by Kuzmenko, Maryna.

This was implemented through Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, Microsoft Visual Studio, and Tableau. The SQL Server Management Studio built the Nobel Prize Data Warehouse and the views, while Visual Studio was used to extract data from the 8 CSV files and create the ETL process. Afterward, the data visualizations based on the processed data are made through Tableau and the SQL queries are made in SQL Server Management Studio. This project will be further explained in the upcoming sections
